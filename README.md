# QuickSelectionSort
Quick Selection Sort Algorithm to find Kth index element in Unsorted Array. 
Quick Selection sort lets you find Kth index element in Unsorted Array.
Though, if you use Randomised Quick Selection Sort,You will have time complexity O(n) in Average cases and O(n^2) in Worst Case.
But if you use, Deterministic Algorithm,You will have O(n) time complexity for worst case, on which i have wrote python code.
Attached python file has code. Please go through it.
